[0.3.0]: https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## Release [0.2.2] - 2025-02-17

[Full changelog](https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.1)

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/releases/tag/v0.2.2

### Changed

- Improved 0.2.x-migration message for `just update`.

### Fixed

- Moving files in the 0.2.0-migration was incomplete and gave git errors due to non-existing folders.
  The just shell recipe was replaced by a new Python recipe to work around the limitations of `git mv`.

## Release [0.2.1] - 2025-02-16

[Full changelog](https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.0)

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/releases/tag/v0.2.1

### Added

- Notes on updating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x to [README.md](./README.md#notes-on-specific-updates).
- Developer tools: Repo and generated project now have a pre-commit configuration with sections for yamllint, typos, ruff (only in project) and some basic checks from pre-commit itself. #50
- Typos spell checker as gh-action for the repo (but not for the generated project). #50
- Added a README to the schema subfolder so that it is added to git even in absence of a schema file.

### Fixed

- Syntax of `just setup` recipe.
- Invalid just recipe name for migrating from 0.1.x to 0.2.x which prevented execution on copier update.
- Excessive whitespace generation in jinja-templates (e.g. in LICENSE files)
- Some LICENSES were not correctly copied to the generated project. #52
- Wrong jinja escaping for creating the example schema and test-page-build action. This led to the creation of the files even if the question was answered with "no" in copier.

### Changed

- All yes/no question are now treated as type bool in copier.
- Ignore also `docs/index.md` and `docs/about.md` when updating with copier.
- Make Python test for example schema/datamodel more general.
- Make `just gen-project` a visible command (it was already present but hidden).
- Improved yamllint configuration and reformatted all non-conforming yaml files in the project. #50
- Change license of linkml-project-copier from CC0 to MIT. #49

### Removed

- Removed schemasheet integration from copier-setup questions and related just recipes. Since it never worked this removal is not considered a breaking change. #46

## Release [0.2.0] - 2025-02-13

[Full changelog](https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/compare/v0.2.0...v0.1.6) relative to v0.1.6 since this was the base of v0.2.0.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/releases/tag/v0.2.0

### Highlights ⚡

**This release implements many of the changes that motivated the project.**

- Cleaner directory structure matching the expectations on mkdocs/python-projects.
  - `docs` is now the permanent storage for docs.
  - `docs/elements` is the new directory for markdown files generated from the schema.
  - `docs/templates-linkml` contains the jinja-templates for customizing the generated schema documentation.
  - `tests/data`-folder is now the primary source of example data (was `src/data`)
- Easier customization of mkdocs documentation: Thanks to the above directory changes, the guidelines from mkdocs on [customizing the theme/js/css](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/customizing-your-theme/) are now directly applicable for projects generated from the template.
- `project/*` all code in this folder is now generated from the schema and no longer included in the template.
- Improved example project (more examples, better tests that use [pytest](https://pytest.org))
- If the example project or if certain GitHub actions should be created or not, can be selected via copier setup questions.
- Several of the changes result in combination in a **low risk of conflicts when updating the underlying template** in existing projects (for future updates after 0.2.0).
- Support `just` as the only command runner. The support for `make` was removed to simplify maintenance.

Most changes were made in one PR (#31) followed by fixups in #42 and #44.

### Removed

- support for make as alternative command runner

### Breaking

- New directory layout for docs and example/test data compared to 0.1.x series (see above)

## Release [0.1.0] - 2025-01-19

[Full changelog](https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/commits/v0.1.0)

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/dalito/linkml-project-copier/releases/tag/v0.1.0

**First release of a new [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)-based [LinkML](https://linkml.io/linkml)-project template.**

- This and later 0.1.x releases are compatible with [linkml-project-cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/) except that they use copier instead of cruft/cookiecutter as scaffolding tool.  
- This release generates the same project as linkml-project-cookiecutter (commit [1094cf2](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/commit/1094cf2ce542028ab0017eaa059dd49cdde81fb5), date 2025-01-10).

### Changed

In comparison to linkml-project-cookiecutter:

- Switch from cruft/cookiecutter to copier. #3
- Replace hooks by copier features and improve updates. #5
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) is the primary command runner instead of make.

### Breaking

In comparison to linkml-project-cookiecutter:

- dot-env-standard compliant formatting of the configuration file (`config.public.mk`). This breaks Makefile-compatibility. See the notes in the file to restore make-conformity.
